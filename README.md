# Neonatal Tracheostomy Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort with Dr. Chris Schmid from the Biostatistics Department to develop a regression model for predicting the need for tracheostomy or the risk of death in neonates with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD). Utilizing a dataset from collaborative NICUs, the project aims to analyze demographic, diagnostic, and respiratory parameters of infants with sBPD at 36 and 44 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). The goal is to improve understanding and guidelines around the timing of tracheostomy placement in these vulnerable patients.
